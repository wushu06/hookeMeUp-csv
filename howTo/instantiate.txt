//
1- to instantiate a class we use a way to allow us not repeat our selfes (we gonna need register function)
we need three functions:

one with array of the class we want to instantiate 
second loop through the array and call the instantiate function then call the register function inside those classes
third instantiate by using new class(); and store it in a variable
