//
1- public function 
    can be access from anywhere

2- protected function 
    // can be access from the class itself or its extend 
4- private function 
    can be access only from the class itself not from extend 

*- static 
    you dont need to intialize the class

    so in the normal class you need to initialzed like this then call the method which sits inside it
    $init_hook_me_up = new hooke_me_up_init();
	$init_hook_me_up->register(); 

    but for static methods you just call the class and its method
    hooke_me_up_init::register();

    inside the class if calling a static function usually $this but with static use the name of the class
