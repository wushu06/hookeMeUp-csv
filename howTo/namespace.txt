//
1- to use namespace: 
    composer init 

    in composer.json 
      "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Inc\\": "./inc"
        }
    }

    then composer install / to edit composer dump-autoload

2- start using namespace: class with same name as folder
  namespace Inc;

  now instead of using require_once and folder name inc we gave the folder name of Inc
  to call class inside this folder 
  Inc\Init::register_services(); meaning go to Inc which is inc folder then the class Init then the static 
  function of register_serivces
